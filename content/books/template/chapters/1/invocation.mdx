Somewhere in the world of Mnemonic, the city of Tower once stood as a monument to the achievements and ingenuity of the peoples of the world. A massive structure, a thousand feet tall, built to withstand the mightiest of dragon attacks, and house a hundred thousand people within during the toughest onslaughts of the Age of War.

It was outside Tower that the final battle took place, where the Grey Mage finally cast the dragons out of existence forever. The world opened up and swallowed the dragons into the space beyond memory. Sadly, half the city of Tower was swallowed with it. What remains in our world is a crumbling wreck, still being repaired by those who survived, some two-hundred years later.

What happened to the other half of the city when it vanished beyond the rift is a tragic mystery that may never be solved. But we can imagine.

Beyond the rift, the city of Tower is a place locked in crisis. People who wander out of the city, or away from designated safe zones, become confused, their minds warped by the chaotic energies of a world that has no memory.

There are some who are equipped to survive short excursions into the Grey Mists of that strange place, who wear masks made of crystal to guard their minds and keep them sharp. In this ritual, we imagine how those brave wanderers work to end the crisis that plagues their broken city.

It is a futile game we play. It wonâ€™t bring our friends home. But perhaps it can give us a little peace, to imagine that their struggles end with a small measure of hope.

To our friends beyond the rift, these words are for you.
